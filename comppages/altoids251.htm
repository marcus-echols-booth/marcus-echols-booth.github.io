<h2>Altoids 251</h2>
<p>
This piece is an amalgamation of musical representations and idioms reflecting the many ways we explore consciousness, and the ways it is influenced or altered by our own choices or by forces beyond our control.   The piece makes extensive use of rap and hip hop danceable and energetic rhythmic devices, juxtaposed with ambient and impressionistic sections of extended harmonies presented arrhythmically, more suited to meditation or relaxation. Framed by periods of stasis and conclusion, and interspersed with anxious periods of plain ambulation, the piece takes listeners through the conditions experienced by someone on a tour of the self.
