<h2>((((Sometimes I Want to) Be) Here) Now)</h2>
<p>
In any given situation, we have an individual and social presence as well as a judgment on it. This piece is a musical commentary on and extension of the work of many modern gurus, neuroscientists, and cultural icons who brought Eastern ideas of mindfulness to the West. The instrumentalists explore individual and collaborative perceptions of a social situation as while engaging in it, they find themselves somewhere between individual and group member, traveling rapidly back and forth between their past and future while contributing to their present and their presence.
