<p>
This piece was partially composed by my direct and specific artistic choices, and partially by chance procedures I devised to alter the scope of my control. The piece is an abstraction of the human condition, as in daily life we feel complete control over certain decisions, impulsive or deliberate, and in other cases we must adapt to circumstances we cannot bend. As the composer, I engaged in this work at every level, from composing every detail of entire passages myself, to leaving all of them entirely to chance, to working around chance results of certain musical elements and reconciling them with choices about others. Temporally and texturally the piece juxtaposes chance and choice in attempt to reflect the variety with which this happens in our existence.
