<h2>Braingame #1</h2>
<p>
<strong>Braingame #1</strong> represents the experience of thinking through a complex task. Permutations of brainstorming and goal oriented thinking unfold in various patterns as questions arise, answers are reached, and answers give rise to more questions. This music sonifies the creation (discovery?) and navigation of oneâ€™s self-constructed epistemological web when faced with a particular situation that consumes all attention. Three dancers demonstrate the metaphysics of internal conversation patterns as the clarinet oscillates between deliberation and dream.
