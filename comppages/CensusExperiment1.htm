<h2>Census Experiment #1</h2>
<p>
This piece is experimental ethnomusicology, involving everything from research to composition to performance in the performance of one work. Passers-by in three locations mentioned in the version title were asked to draw on index cards according to procedures that require no musical training, to make choices about the elements of harmony, rhythm, and dynamics. Within the parameters chosen by my audience, I improvise a piano piece to reflect the musical instincts of the community I currently find myself in.
