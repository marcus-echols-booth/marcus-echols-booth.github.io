<h2>Intentionality, Control, and Complexity in Composition: Around and Beyond the Serial-Aleatoric Distinction</h2>
<p>
This essay is associated with my composition, "33132122321122233321321121231". Here I undertake detailed investigation of the relationship of chance and choice, planned versus inevitable indeterminacy, the repositioning or restructuring of the composer's will, and the determination of creative space by structured randomness. I survey and select from historical, personal, and quantitative resources in creating and describing the system that generates the associated composition. A detailed account is provided, describing both the general approach and a particular outcome.
