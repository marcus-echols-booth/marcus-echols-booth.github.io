<h2>The Man</h2>

<p>Marcus Anomalous (b. Santa Monica, CA) is a composer, philosopher, and mathematician currently residing in New Orleans, LA. His work seeks to identify and bring together the undeniable yet difficult to reconcile aspects of the modern human condition. Whether lecturing on the computational aspects of critical theory or presenting music in which he mediates conversations between minds and machines, Marcus listens and represents. What does it sound like when logic and emotion compete? What does it sound like when the interests of the individual and the group are balanced in an environment of uncertainty? What does it sound like to decide? To get along? To know?
Marcus isn’t sure yet but he’s going to figure it out one of these days if you’ll just wait.</p>
